1
00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:02,207
Shadow is falling over creation.

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:04,813
Something vast is stirring
in the dark.

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:08,157
That man is dead.

4
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:09,970
Tonight, he returns.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,307
My name...

6
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:12,393
is The Master.

7
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,595
A part of him survived.

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,186
Never dying. The never-ending drums.

9
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:20,631
Can you hear it?
The noise, the drumbeat?

10
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:22,451
Louder than ever before!

11
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:25,893
Time is bleeding.

12
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:27,155
What do you mean?

13
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,577
The darkness heralds
only one thing...

14
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:32,226
The End of Time itself.
